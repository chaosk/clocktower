## What is Blood on the Clocktower?

It's a social deduction game, for 5-15 players -- plus one storyteller (a person to run it) -- in the spirit of Mafia or Werewolf.

Two teams face off:

- A **small evil team** that knows who each other are.
- A **larger good team** that must figure things out without that knowledge.

Unlike other social deduction games, _everyone gets a unique role_ -- and **you keep playing even after you die**.<br/>
No player elimination here!

### OK, I'm new here, what do I do?

Just head to the next page! You'll find everything you need to get started.

We promise it's friendly[^legal-disclaimer] -- we were all beginners not long ago.

### Cool! I want to play!

There's a game happening every week!

1. Check out the Slack channel for details.
2. **Watch for the weekly message** and **react to it** to mark your interest and availability.
3. Reserve about **90 minutes** for a session.

### Need help learning?

No worries -- weâ€™ve got you.

You can either:

- **Read the next few pages** to get a feel for the game.
- **Ask in the Slack thread** for a quick rules explanation that will happen *before the scheduled game start*.

The storyteller and fellow players are always happy to help. :-)
