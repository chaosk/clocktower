## What is Blood on the Clocktower?

It's a social deduction game, for 5-15 players -- plus a person to run it -- in style similar to Mafia or Werewolf.

It pits against each other two teams: one smaller, that knows who each other are; and one larger which doesn't have that privilege.

Contrary to aforementioned games, in here everyone gets a special role and you still continue playing for your team after dying -- there's no player elimination!

### Cool! I want to play!

Look for the most recent poll to tell us what your availability is.
We're trying to play once a week, so most voted day is when we'll play.

Time's also announced in the poll. Reserve 90 minutes slot for a single game.

Also, since 12 players is universally agreed as the best possible player count,
first 12 people to confirm the date in the poll will be playing.
Feel free to join anyway, as there can be no-shows,
or alternatively you could spectate (that's fun too!).

Since this game allows for multitude of things that players can do,
there's _some_ homework required to avoid being completely clueless before starting.

Not to worry though, we (players and the storyteller) will guide newcomers.

We're all just beginners at this anyway.
