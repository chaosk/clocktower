## Teams

It's a team game. You learn your alignment when you learn what your character is.

### üîµ Good team [#good]

If you get a token with a **blue** character, you're good.

Good team is the majority of players. It's comprised of _Townsfolk_ and _Outsiders_. Once the demon is dead, the good team wins.

### üî¥ Evil team [#evil]

If you get a token with a **red** character, you're evil.

Evil team is a small subset of players. It's comprised of _Minions_ and _Demon_. Evil wins when there's only 2 players left alive (one of them being the demon).

While evil team starts the game in severe numbers disadvantage, they start the game knowing who is part of the evil team (and their character types). Also, the demon knows some characters that are not in play, allowing for easier bluffing.

## Game phases

The game operates in a cycle of night and day phases, starting with night 1 and ending when a victory condition is met.

### üò¥ Night phase [#night]

Characters whose ability makes them do _something_ at night are woken by the storyteller and make appropriate choices, and/or receive information. This includes the demon that wakes and chooses a player to die.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Day phase [#day]

During the day, all players are free to go off and have private conversations.

After some time (storyteller will roughly tell how much), players will be called back and eventually be asked to start nominating as they please.

#### Nominations and execution [#nominations]

Nomination is a vote to execute a player at the end of the day. Number of required votes for the vote to pass and mark the nominated player for execution is half of the currently living players. However, there can be further nominations, and if someone else gets more votes, that player is marked instead. Getting the same amount of votes means both players are safe.

Every day, each alive player can nominate once, and each player can be nominated once.

Once there's no more nominations, the marked player is executed (and dies). The game proceeds to the next night phase (or ends if a winning condition is met).

## Dead vs alive

Dying in this game does not result in player elimination. Players that have been killed continue playing, however:
- they lose their character ability;
- they can no longer nominate;
- they can only vote for *one* nomination until the end of the game (also called their dead/ghost vote).

Dead players are still vital to their team success, as they can keep sharing whatever information or opinions they have.

## Characters

At the beginning of the game, storyteller will choose - from a full set of characters that are of the [script](/scripts) you're playing - a subset of characters that will be in the game. These will be randomly assigned to every player.

See [character distribution](/rules/character-distribution) to see how many of each type there's in a given game.

Characters are split into:

### Townsfolk

Good characters that have abilities to help the good team win the game. This can include receiving information or protecting other players.

Example: **[Empath](/scripts/trouble-brewing#empath)** learns every night how many of their living neighbors are evil.

### Outsiders

Good characters that have negatively impact the good team. This can include additional loss conditions or affecting other character's information.

Example: **[Saint](/scripts/trouble-brewing#saint)** can cause an immediate good team loss if executed.

### Minions

Evil characters meant to help the Demon survive until the end of the game, and to cause misinformation among good players.

Example: **[Poisoner](/scripts/trouble-brewing#poisoner)** can cause other players' abilities to malfunction.

### Demon

Evil character that kills at night and is the main target of the good team.

Example: **[Imp](/scripts/trouble-brewing#imp)** can kill every night (except the first one), and can also target themselves to move the **Imp** character to a minion.

## Poisoned/drunk state [#poison-drunk]

Certain abilities (for example: **[Poisoner](/scripts/trouble-brewing#poisoner)**) can apply a poisoned/drunk state to a player. The general rule is that those players are treated as if they don't have their ability, but are meant to think that it still works correctly. Which means:

- if the ability is meant to change the game state in any way, it can't (Example: poisoned **[Monk](/scripts/trouble-brewing#monk)** can never protect anyone, but they're asked to choose anyway);
- if the ability provides information, it _may_ be incorrect (Example: poisoned **[Empath](/scripts/trouble-brewing#empath)** can learn that either 0, 1, or 2 of their living neighbors are evil, storyteller decides).

## Each night vs Each* night [#each-night-asterisk]

Some character abilities have an asterisk next to the word _Each_. This means this ability **doesn't happen** on the first night.
