## Teams

*Blood on the Clocktower* is a **team-based social deduction game**. You‚Äôll learn your character and alignment at the start of the game.

### üîµ Good team [#good]

- **Blue token = you're good**
- Makes up the majority of players
- Includes:
  - **Townsfolk** ‚Äì helpful abilities
  - **Outsiders** ‚Äì abilities that hinder the good team
- **Goal:** Execute the Demon

### üî¥ Evil team [#evil]

- **Red token = you're evil**
- A small group of players who **know each other**
- Includes:
  - **Minions** ‚Äì helpers and misleaders
  - **The Demon** ‚Äì the killer
- **Goal:** Have the Demon alive when only 2 players remain

## Game phases

Game alternates between **Night** and **Day** phases (starting with Night 1) until one team wins.

### üò¥ Night phase [#night]

- Players with night abilities (including the Demon) are woken by the Storyteller and act

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Day phase [#day]

- Players can chat in public as well as privately
- After some time, players are called back and the **nominations** begin

#### Nominations and execution [#nominations]

- Each alive player can **nominate one person per day**
- Players listen to the accusation, then to the defence of the accused, and the vote is run
- A player is marked for execution if they receive votes equal to or greater than half the number of living players (rounded up) _(For example, if there are 7 players alive, 4 votes are needed.)_
- Further nominations can overwrite the marked player if someone gets more votes
- Ties = no execution
- Once nominations end, the marked player is executed, and the night phase begins again

## Dead vs alive

Death isn‚Äôt the end! Dead players:

- Lose their character ability
- Can‚Äôt nominate
- Get **one final vote** for the rest of the game (their *ghost vote*)

But they can still:
- Talk
- Share theories
- Help their team!

## Characters

Before each game, the **Storyteller** selects characters from a [script](/scripts). Characters are **randomly assigned** to players.

See [Character Distribution](/rules/character-distribution) for how many of each type can appear.

Characters are split into:

### Townsfolk

Helpful characters on the good team.

_Example: **[Empath](/scripts/trouble-brewing#empath)** learns each night how many of their living neighbors are evil_

### Outsiders

Good team characters that cause confusion or harm.

_Example: **[Saint](/scripts/trouble-brewing#saint)** causes an instant **loss** for the good team if executed_

### Minions

Support the Demon by spreading misinformation.

_Example: **[Poisoner](/scripts/trouble-brewing#poisoner)** can cause other players' abilities to malfunction_

### Demon

Kills each night and must survive to win.

Demon also starts the game knowing 3 characters that are definitely not in play (so called _Demon bluffs_).

_Example: **[Imp](/scripts/trouble-brewing#imp)** can kill at night. If they kill themselves, one of their Minions becomes the new Imp._

## Poisoned/drunk state [#poison-drunk]

Some effects (e.g., from a **Poisoner**) make players **drunk or poisoned**. That means:

- Your ability **doesn't work**, but you **think it does**
- If your ability gives info, that info **might be wrong**
- If your ability changes the game, **it won't work**

_Examples:_
_A poisoned **[Slayer](/scripts/trouble-brewing#slayer)** publicly chooses a player that's actually the Demon ‚Äî it has no effect._
_A poisoned **[Empath](/scripts/trouble-brewing#empath)** might receive false numbers._

## Each night vs Each* night [#each-night-asterisk]

Some abilities say **‚ÄúEach\* night‚Äù** ‚Äî the asterisk means **it does NOT activate on the first night**.

Pay attention to that asterisk!
