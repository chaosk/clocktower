Engage in small talk until the game's ready. Or don't and find a suitable alternative.

## First night and night info

Once the game starts, you'll receive a token with your character and the first night will begin.

Here's some examples of how that can look like for different characters:

<Tabs items={['Fortune Teller', 'Scarlet Woman']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Video src="/tutorials/first-night-fortune-teller.mp4" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Video src="/tutorials/first-night-scarlet-woman.mp4" />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

If you miss the info, you can get back to it by clicking **Night info** in the top-right corner:

## Taking your notes

You can treat the Grimoire you see on the screen as your personal notepad for the information you receive,
as well as characters people share with you, or any other information you might want to write down.

None of this information is visible to others.

## Private conversations

### Night whispers

At night, you can only privately send text messages to your neighbours (that simulates real-life setting where you can only attempt to whisper to people near you). You can do that by pressing `[Enter]` and selecting the ‚úâÔ∏è icon displayed in the token of one of the neighbours.

<Callout type="info">
  Every message sent at night shows up to others as a little envelope being passed between two players.
</Callout>

### Private chats

During the day, you can invite anyone to have a private chat with. You do that by pressing _Request Private Chat_ (or pressing `[Enter]`) and selecting the üí¨ icon on their token. They'll receive an invite and if they accept, no other player can join you without your consent.

You can leave every chat by pressing the exit icon in the _Voice_ panel, or by pressing `[Backspace]`.

<Callout type="info">
  Anyone can see where everyone is at a given moment, so people can see who everyone's talking to.
</Callout>

There's also a few pre-existing rooms that people can join to have conversations in.
