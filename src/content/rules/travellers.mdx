# Travellers

Joining late or leaving early? You can still play -- as a Traveller.

Travellers are special characters the Storyteller can add at any time. They have strong abilities, but gain little or no information.

- Can join or leave mid-game.
- Don’t count toward the “2 living players” end-game condition.
- Their **character** is public; their **alignment** (good or evil) is not.
- Evil Travellers learn who the **Demon** is (but not the Minions or bluffs).
- They're exiled, not executed.
- Exile votes require **half of all players** to pass and **don’t use ghost votes**.

> Maximum power, minimum responsibility.

_Example: Evil [**Scapegoat**](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Scapegoat) is in play. As the Demon gets executed, the Storyteller decides to execute the Scapegoat instead._
