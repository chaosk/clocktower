<Callout type="info">
  When the game starts with the Drunk, the Storyteller will add one more Townsfolk token instead of adding the Drunk token into the pool of characters. After all characters are randomly assigned, the Storyteller chooses one Townsfolk to be the Drunk.

  Storyteller will interact with the Drunk player as if they were the character they originally saw.

  <figcaption>Example: **Dave** thinks he's the Undertaker, when in reality he's the Drunk. Charlie just died from an execution caused by him nominating the Virgin. Storyteller can show Dave *any* role, not just the Washerwoman, because Dave's the Drunk. Storyteller decides to show the **Spy** token.</figcaption>
